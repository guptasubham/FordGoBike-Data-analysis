### UDACITY'S DATA-ANALYST NANODEGREE - PROJECT 5


### NEED OF DATA-ANALYSIS?
> Data analysis is an internal organisational function performed by Data Analysts that is more than merely presenting numbers and figures to management. It requires a much more in-depth approach to recording, analysing and dissecting data, and presenting the findings in an easily-digestible format.  

Data is core of a business. There is a saying, you can’t improve what you can’t measure. so, businesses have been trying to setup metrics for their core business parameters.  

With the advancements of new technologies, like social media evolution, mobile technologies, big data storage and processing, cloud technology and machine learning — Data got a completely new dimension. Data came outside, or at least the presence was felt outside of its four boundaries of the enterprises. Now, the data is present everywhere. Every second, someone, somewhere is collecting a lot of data about us. 

> DATA VISUALIZATION:  
Data analysis is important in business to understand problems facing an organisation, and to explore data in meaningful ways. Data in itself is merely facts and figures. Data visualization interprets, structures and presents the data into useful information that provides context for the data. This context can then be used by decision-makers to take action with the aim of enhancing productivity and business gain.

## Project Details  
1. [FordGoBike dataset](https://s3.amazonaws.com/baywheels-data/index.html)  
2. Explore the data: Feel free to explore the jupyter notebook where the dataset is visually, and programatically explored.  
3. Document the story: organized findings convey a story to present to an audience.  
4. Communicate the findings - a slide deck with my findings is prepared for a curious audience.

# **FordGoBike bike-sharing company-**
FordGoBike is a public bike sharing system currently operating in the San Francisco, San Jose and East-Bay area of California,USA. It began it's service in 2013 with only 700 bikes servicing arround 70 locations arround the Bay-Area,San Francisco. Since then the FordGoBike system has expanded to over 7000 bikes covering three major regions in California. In the month of June-2019, FordGoBike systems changed it's branding to Lyft BayWheels Bike Sharing Company. It is currently a major player in the bikes sharing market in the region, with key-players being UBER, JUMP and LIME.

Like other bike sharing services, the FordGoBike systems also has a network of specially designed sturdy and attractive bikes that are suitable for all types of users.The bikes can unlocked from any station through the mobile app and can be returned to any other station within the servicing area, making it an ideal choice for one-way trips around the city.The bikes are available 24/7 and people use it to commute to work, to school or any other social events in a fun,convenient and affordable way.

## KEY-PROJECT FINDINGS:
> 1. Renting a bike from the FordGoBike bike-sharing system is an affordable and convenient way of commuting in and arround the city, both for enjoyment and work.
2. It is an environment friendly and life-style friendly mode of transportation as there are people with different life-styles being office worker,school student,college student,store worker,leisure purpose,etc.
3. Subscribers or the daily commuters are a group that uses the bikes for short rides primarily to and fro from work.They use the bikes mostly on weekdays during the official hours i.e. morning(8-9)a.m. and evening(6-8)p.m.
4. Customers or occassional riders are mostly tourists who uses the bikes for going arround the places and sight-seeing the bay-area.They use the bikes mostly on the weekends between 11a.m to 6p.m, but on weekdays they prefer to go out between 4p.m to 6p.m.
5. It was seen in the explorations that on the weekdays the one-time-customers used the bikes from 4-6p.mm in the evening after which the office rush-hour starts.Here the point of availability of the bikes could arise and determine the revenew generated.  

There is found to be two groups of user's that are using the bike-sharing system in the bay-area.One group of user's are the 'Subscribers' who use the bikes for small trips basically for to-and-fro work, These group use the bikes for shorter distances and lesser durations.It is also observed that the subscriber's used the bike-sharing system mostly on the weekdays during the official hours.Thus it strongly suggests that the subscribers used the bikes for their daily commute.

On the other hand, the other group of user's the one-time-customers ride the bikes for greater durations and longer distances.This group of user's also used the bikes mostly on the weekends in the afternoon and during 4p.m to 6p.m in the weekday evenings.Hence it reveals that the customer group of user's are mostly tourists or people who want to go around the bay-area for fresh breeze and spend some leisure time or even go partying on weekend nights.

## Files:
1. readme.md - This Markdown file contains sections that you should fill out as you select your dataset, complete your exploration, and plan your explanatory analysis.

2. exploration_template.ipynb - This Jupyter Notebook contains section templates to help you organize your exploration, starting from loading in the data, working through univariate visualizations, and ending with bivariate and multivariate exploration.

3. slide_deck_template.ipynb - This Jupyter Notebook contains starter cells to help you organize your slide deck deliverable. These cells provide an example of how the slide deck should be organized, including pre-set slideshow settings.

### REVIEW:
The project is well documented.The project makes the dataset reveal the different user types using the bikes.The person has made good efforts of attracting the viewers attention by putting attractive questions to the viewers.The efforts for putting the graphs is very well performed and documented.The project really made me feel like watching a sherlock holmes movie and made me believe that subscriber's use the bikes for daily office visits and the customers use the bikes for personal use.
